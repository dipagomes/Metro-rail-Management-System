Dhaka Metro Rail, informally known as the Dhaka Metro, is an approved mass rapid
transit system in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The construction
of the Mass Rapid Transit Line-6 or MRT-6 which is a part of the ongoing Dhaka Metro Rail
Project in Bangladesh is well on course for delivery in December this year. MRT-6 which is

For this Metro rail we developed a web application which will control all the work behind the metro
