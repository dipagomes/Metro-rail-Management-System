# Metro-rail-Management-System

Dhaka Metro Rail, informally known as the Dhaka Metro, is an approved mass rapid
transit system in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The construction
of the Mass Rapid Transit Line-6 or MRT-6 which is a part of the ongoing Dhaka Metro Rail
Project in Bangladesh is well on course for delivery in December 2022. MRT-6 which is
the country’s first metro rail which is running from Uttara to Agargaon.
For this Metro rail we developed a web application which will control all the work behind the metro
rail needed. Like people can book ticket, administrator can keep track about rails and other information. Employee have
some management system. In a word we will build a application that run the total metro rail
project.
Here we wanted to make a complete web application that will control the whole metro-
rail system. Now the world are more comfortable in
web application. Because it's easy for collaboration and remote access. And it
have operating system independence that’s why we have chosen it to make a web
application.
